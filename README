GtkTetcolor
===========

GtkTetcolor is reimplementation of tetcolor game made for DOS by 
S. Sotnikov on 1991. GtkTetcolor is a game that resembles well-known tetris
and columns. The rules of the game are simple - you can move or rotate
the block which continue to fall. After block landing the sequence of at
least three cells horizontally, vertically or diagonally having matching
colors is removed and the above blocks will collapse. If two or more
sequences will be removed simultaneously the player has got bonus
points. The game will be over when new block cannot be placed on screen. 

It was made with Glade - http://glade.gnome.org


Requirements
============

 o GTK+ 2.6.0 or above - http://www.gtk.org
 o GNOME (optional, 2.x version) - http://www.gnome.org
 

Installation
============

It should be possible to do an installation by doing
    ./configure
    make
    make install
in the top directory.
If you have GNOME and don't want to compile gtktetcolor with GNOME support use 
./configure --disable-gnome instead. You can define other prefix than
default /usr/local with --prefix option. For example
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
It is recommended to install GNOME version of gtktetcolor with the same
prefix as gnome-libs. Probably you also will need to change local state
directory for modifiable  single-machine data, it may differ from
default PREFIX/var on your machine.


Installation on Windows
=======================

Gtktetcolor can be compiled for win32 platform with Cygwin/MinGW
(http://www.cygwin.com) gcc compiler and linked with gtk+-2.x library
(http://www.gimp.org/win32). Set CFLAGS shell variable to 
"-mno-cygwin -mms-bitfields -mwindows -DWIN32" before running configure
script.

Score file for non-GNOME version
================================

You can create system score file PREFIX/share/gtktetcolor/gtktetcolor_score
(where PREFIX is usually /usr/local) writable for users.
For example:
    touch /usr/local/share/gtktetcolor/gtktetcolor_score
    chmod 664 /usr/local/share/gtktetcolor/gtktetcolor_score
    chgrp users /usr/local/share/gtktetcolor/gtktetcolor_score
    
If system score file will be unwritable for user, .gtktetcolor_score file from
home directory will be used.    

GNOME-enabled Gtktetcolor uses standard GNOME routines.

Sounds
======

Sound files distributed with this version are borrowed from gnome games.
They should be replaced with own wave files. Does anybody help to create them?


Score accounting
================

Since I cannot decrypt formula of DOS tetcolor I use own:

   Score = Bonus + Line,

where Line is points for each deleted line and Bonus is added when
simultaneously more than 1 line disappears.

   Line = 40*(1 + (level - 1)*0.1)*(1 + 0.25*(5 - n)),

where n is number of cells in the line.   

            / (lines - 1)*500,           if 1 < lines <= 11,
	    |
   Bonus = <  5000 + 2500*(lines - 11),  if 11 < lines <= 17,
            |
	    \ 20000 + 5000*(lines - 17), if 17 < lines,

where lines is number of simultaneously destroyed lines.
